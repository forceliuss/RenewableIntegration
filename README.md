# RenewableIntegration

This is an experimental project!! The main objective of this project is to create a dashboard to analyse the data from several sources and develop a common place for these insights.

## Datasets

- Renewable Energy (1960 - 2023) - main source (https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/energy/renewable-energy/indicator/english_aac7c3f1-en)
  <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/renewable-energy-1960-2023' target='_blank'>Kaggle dataset</a>

- World GDP by Country (1960 - 2022)
  <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/world-gdp-data' target='_blank'>Kaggle dataset</a>

## Code focus objectives

- Import and clear the data from the datasets
- Combine all the different sources into a main dataframe
